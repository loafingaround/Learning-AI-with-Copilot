    "#A: A neural network is a computational model that is inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information.\n",
    "# The key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information processing system. It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurones) working in unison to solve specific problems. A neural network is a massively parallel distributed processor made up of simple processing units, which has a natural propensity for storing experiential knowledge and making it available for use. It resembles the brain in two respects:\n",
    "# 1. Knowledge is acquired by the network from its environment through a learning process.\n",
    "# 2. Interneuron connection strengths, known as synaptic weights, are used to store the acquired knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q: What differentiates a convolutional neural network from a regular neural network?\n",
    "#A: Convolutional Neural Networks are very similar to ordinary Neural Networks from the previous chapter:\n",
    "# they are made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases. Each neuron receives some inputs, performs\n",
    "# a dot product and optionally follows it with a non-linearity. The whole network still expresses a single differentiable\n",
    "# score function: from the raw image pixels on one end to class scores at the other. And they still have a loss function\n",
    "# (e.g. SVM/Softmax) on the last (fully-connected) layer and all the tips/tricks we developed for learning regular\n",
    "# Neural Networks still apply.\n",
    "# So what changes? ConvNet architectures make the explicit assumption that the inputs are images, which allows us to\n",
    "# encode certain properties into the architecture. These then make the forward function more efficient to implement\n",
    "# and vastly reduce the amount of parameters in the network.\n",

    "#Q: What tools are most commonly used to work with Convolutional Neural Networks?\n",
